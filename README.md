# About 

My name is Kristopher Esparza and I was born and raised in the small town of Fremont Ohio. I am coming up on 10 years in the Air Force and have seen many different places. Currently, I am deployed and my home station is in [Scott AFB](https://www.scott.af.mil/). I have been there for over 4 years now and love the area. There is so much to do around the base with [St. Louis](https://explorestlouis.com/) being 30 minutes away. My girlfriend and I just celebrated my son's first birthday, which was a little disappointing since I wasn't able to celebrate it with them. I will be head back close to the time my class is ending so we hope to make up for the lost time.

Some of the things I love to do are watch football and tailgate. Being from Ohio I am of course an [Ohio State Buckeyes](https://ohiostatebuckeyes.com/sports/m-footbl/) fan. I was a little disappointed with the way this year-end but, to be honest, I think they did better than what was expected from them. I can't wait for this COVID situation to end so I/we can go back to being around our friends and family.
